## Give Visibilty to Small Buisiness

"My app idea is to help small buisnesses in Albuqueque become more visible, 
the thing is, small buisnesses don't have the resources to put themselves 
on the map and show customers how unique they are or how much they have 
to offer the community. This app will give a chance to small buisnesses 
to list their products, emphasis will be given to unique products, location, 
pictures, and a glimse at the story behind their buisness. The customer would 
type a particular product they are searching for and all small buisnesses 
that sale that product will come up, with a list of similar products and 
possibly an option for delivery through Uber or Lyft.

The customer will put in their information and a wish list, they will be
 notified when the product they are looking for is available."
